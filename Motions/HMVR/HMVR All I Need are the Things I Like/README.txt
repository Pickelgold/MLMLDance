Motion by Degica/Crypton Future Media
Convert to MMD by FlyingSpirits-P
Providing animation files and teaching me how to convert HMVR motions to mmd - iiCxmeron_
Figure out how to convert the legs to IKs - iiCxmeron_
How to use:
Make sure to have the waist bone in the same position as the lowerbody and have your model in a A-POSE "this may vary on the model; you might have to lower or raise the arms just by a bit for it to work properly; I had to do -5 on my PDX miku's arms"
also make sure your lowerbody is parented to the waist bone and have the waist bone parented to the groove bone

If you come across the leg issue of it not following the body, please find these bones "腰キャンセル左/腰キャンセル右" and disable the rot+/append+ on them then the motion should be working properly now.

Have fun using the Motion!
Note: I don't believe my motion converts are perfect or stable but I try my best!
